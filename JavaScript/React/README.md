# React Coding Exercise

Example React App that has a list of grocery items that can be filtered by an edit field.
Each grocery item has a quantity and the sum of the displayed items is listed at the bottom.
Future application improvements will include allowing the quantity for each item to be editable.

## Task

1. Fix compiliation errors (1)
2. Fix runtime errors and console warnings (1)
3. Find and fix obvious bugs (2)

To begin, run `npm install` on the command line, followed by `npm start` (see below for details).

### `npm install`

Installs all project dependencies.<br />

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
